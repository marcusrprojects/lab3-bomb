phase_1: "To infinity...and beyond!"

This code moves the value at address 0x402547 into the register %esi, and
compares the inputted value to this. Calling on <strings_not_equal>, it 
will pass the test so that it will jump to the next stage if they are equal,
harnessing condition codes with "test." If not, it will blow up. Therefore,
the value must equal "To infinity...and beyond!" as this is the string that
is located in the address 0x402547.
